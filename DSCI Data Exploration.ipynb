    "Heart diseases refers to types of heart conditions in which their common symptoms vary from having heart attacks, arrhythmia (abnormal heart beats), to heart failure. Though these symptoms may exist for some people, many cannot be diagnosed unless experienced one of the conditions. Our question we would like to address is predicting the presence of heart disease by working with four variables as the predictors. The four variables are age, maximum heart rate, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol (These predictors are subjected to change as we move towards the end of the course as we learn how to find which are the best predictors). The accuracy of our model could be helpful as being the preliminary test to see if a patient needs further diagnosis before clinicians coming up with suitable treatment models for that patient.  For our project, we chose to focus on a dataset from UCI Machine Learning that contains data pulled from Hungary, Cleveland, Switzerland, and Longbeach that we found on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset. \n",

    "The four variables we chose are resting blood pressure, age, maximum heart rate, and cholesterol. We chose Blood pressure because having high blood pressure is one of the biggest risks of heart disease, as stated on the CDC website.  Blood pressure increases the workload of the heart, as it is the pressure of blood pushing along arteries, and having a higher blood pressure makes the heart muscle become stiffer(Grey, 2021). We chose cholesterol because high cholesterol, according to the CDC, builds up and blocks the vessels, which can induce a heart attack, especially the \"bad\" type of cholesterol.  We chose maximum heart rate as a predictor because having a high heart rate is associated with a higher risk of mortality and heart-associated disease(Guillaume, et al.). As stated by Guillaume, et al., “...the risk associated with accelerated heart rate is not only statistically significant but also clinically relevant and that it should be taken into account in the evaluation of the patients.” We chose age because according to the CDC, with an increase in age, there is an increase in the risk of developing heart disease because there is a higher build of fatty deposits in arteries(narrower flow of blood in arteries) and also higher blood pressure\n",

    "\n",
    " We chose 4 specific predictors because of the online research(external resources) and readings we did prior, pinpointing the main contributors to heart disease, and we found out that these factors have an immense impact on increasing the risk of heart disease, and are the most important to consider. \n",
